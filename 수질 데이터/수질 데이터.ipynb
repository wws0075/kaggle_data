WHO는 pH의 최대 허용 한계를 6.5에서 8.5로 권장했습니다. 현재 조사 범위는 6.52~6.83으로 WHO 기준 범위에 있다. <br/>\n","- 경도(Hardness)\n","    - 경도는 주로 칼슘과 마그네슘 염에 의해 발생합니다. 이 염은 물이 이동하는 지질 퇴적물에서 용해됩니다. 물이 경도 생성 물질과 접촉하는 시간은 원수의 경도를 결정하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 경도는 원래 칼슘과 마그네슘에 의해 비누를 침전시키는 물의 능력으로 정의되었습니다.\n","- 고형물(총 용존 고형물 - TDS) / Solids (Total dissolved solids - TDS)\n","    - 물은 칼륨, 칼슘, 나트륨, 중탄산염, 염화물, 마그네슘, 황산염 등과 같은 광범위한 무기 및 일부 유기 미네랄 또는 염을 용해하는 능력이 있습니다. 이러한 미네랄은 원하지 않는 맛과 물의 외관에 희석된 색상을 생성합니다. 이것은 물 사용의 중요한 매개변수입니다. TDS 값이 높은 물은 물이 고도로 광물화되었음을 나타냅니다. TDS의 바람직한 한도는 500 mg/l이고 최대 한도는 음용으로 규정된 1000 mg/l입니다.\n","- 클로라민(Chloramines)\n","    - 염소와 클로라민은 공공 상수도 시스템에서 사용되는 주요 소독제입니다. 클로라민은 암모니아가 염소에 첨가되어 음용수를 처리할 때 가장 일반적으로 형성됩니다. 리터당 최대 4밀리그램(mg/L 또는 4ppm(4ppm))의 염소 수준은 식수에서 안전한 것으로 간주됩니다.\n","- 황산염(Sulfate)\n","    - 황산염은 광물, 토양 및 암석에서 발견되는 자연 발생 물질입니다. 그들은 주변 공기, 지하수, 식물 및 음식에 존재합니다. 황산염의 주요 상업적 용도는 화학 산업입니다. 해수의 황산염 농도는 리터당 약 2,700밀리그램(mg/L)입니다. 일부 지리적 위치에서는 훨씬 더 높은 농도(1000mg/L)가 발견되지만 대부분의 담수 공급에서 3~30mg/L 범위입니다.\n","- 전도도(Conductivity)\n","    - 순수한 물은 전류의 좋은 전도체가 아니라 좋은 절연체입니다. 이온 농도의 증가는 물의 전기 전도성을 향상시킵니다. 일반적으로 물에 용해된 고형물의 양은 전기 전도도를 결정합니다. 전기 전도도(EC)는 실제로 용액이 전류를 전달할 수 있도록 하는 용액의 이온 과정을 측정합니다. WHO 표준에 따르면 EC 값은 400μS/cm를 초과해서는 안 됩니다.\n","- 유기탄소(Organic_carbon)\n","    - 원수의 총유기탄소(TOC)는 썩어가는 천연유기물질(NOM)과 합성원에서 발생합니다. TOC는 순수한 물에 있는 유기 화합물의 총 탄소량을 측정한 것입니다. US EPA에 따르면 처리/음용수에서 TOC로 < 2 mg/L, 처리에 사용되는 원수에서 < 4 mg/Lit.\n","- 트리할로메탄(Trihalomethanes)\n","    - THM은 염소 처리된 물에서 발견될 수 있는 화학 물질입니다. 음용수의 THM 농도는 물의 유기 물질 수준, 물을 처리하는 데 필요한 염소의 양 및 처리되는 물의 온도에 따라 다릅니다. 최대 80ppm의 THM 수준은 식수에서 안전한 것으로 간주됩니다.\n","- 탁도(Turbidity)\n","    - 물의 탁도는 부유 상태에 존재하는 고형물의 양에 따라 달라집니다. 물의 발광 특성을 측정하는 척도로 콜로이드 물질에 대한 폐기물 배출 품질을 나타내는 데 사용됩니다. 원도 제넷캠퍼스에서 얻은 평균 탁도 값(0.98 NTU)은 WHO 권장 값인 5.00 NTU보다 낮습니다.\n","- 이식성(Potability)\n","    - 물이 사람이 섭취하기에 안전한지 여부를 나타냅니다. 여기서 1은 음용 가능, 0은 음용 불가를 의미합니다.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"e1pk786bxNdh"},"source":["### 사용할 알고리즘\n","- 나이브 베이즈\n","- 확률적 경사하강법\n","- 로지스틱 회귀\n","- k-최근접 이웃\n","- 의사 결정 트리\n","- 랜덤 포레스트\n","- 서포트
